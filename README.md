## ðŸ”“ Public Repositories & Disclaimers

Much of my work is hosted in **private GitHub organizations** due to client confidentiality. However, Iâ€™ve included several public examples primarily from my **MSc in Enterprise Software Systems (2020â€“2023)**.

ðŸ§  I achieved distinctions across key modules:

- **Agile Software Development** â€“ 100  
- **Dissertation** â€“ 100  
- **User Experience Design** â€“ 97  
- **Data Mining** â€“ 94  
- **Enterprise Web Development** â€“ 92  
- **Cloud Architecture** â€“ 90  
- **Research Methods** â€“ 91  
- **Business Intelligence** â€“ 77

These repos include early cloud prototypes (e.g., CloudFormation) and newer tools I now favor (Terraform, Serverless Framework). While some dependencies may be outdated, they showcase key architecture patterns. I'm happy to demo a PoC on request.
